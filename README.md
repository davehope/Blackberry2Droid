This is the C# (.Net 2.0) sourcecode for [Blackberry2Droid](https://damn.technology/blackberry2droid), a free application that would convert Blackberry IPD/BBB files to an XML format supported by "SMS Backup and Restore". In theory, output format could be used.

The only dependancy is the [Ionic ZIP library](https://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/) which is licensed under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).
